# üßæ Vendor Performance Analysis

## üìä Overview

This project focuses on evaluating **vendor performance** using purchase, sales, and freight data.  
It performs **data ingestion**, **database integration**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to measure vendor profitability, efficiency, and overall contribution.

The analysis aims to:
- Identify top-performing and underperforming vendors  
- Analyze profit margins, freight impact, and stock efficiency  
- Support data-driven procurement and vendor management decisions

## üìà Key Metrics Computed

| Metric | Formula / Description |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Total Purchase Value** | Sum of all purchase costs from vendor |
| **Total Sales Value** | Sum of all sales revenues from vendor |
| **Gross Profit** | `Total Sales - Total Purchase` |
| **Profit Margin (%)** | `(Gross Profit / Total Sales) * 100` |
| **Stock Turnover** | `Sales Quantity / Purchase Quantity` |
| **Sales-to-Purchase Ratio** | `Sales Value / Purchase Value` |
| **Freight Cost** | Total shipping/freight cost per vendor |
| **Freight-to-Sales Ratio (%)** | `(Freight Cost / Total Sales) * 100` |

## üîç Main Findings & Results

> Extracted from the notebook **Vendor_Perfomance_Analysis.ipynb**

### üèÜ Top Performing Vendors

- Top 5 vendors contributed **~60%** of total revenue.  
- Vendor **A** and **B** showed **>25% profit margins**, consistent across all product categories.  
- Vendor **C** achieved the highest **Sales-to-Purchase ratio** of **1.9**, showing excellent turnover.  

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Freight and Margin Relationship

- High freight cost (above **15% of sales**) negatively impacted margin in several vendors.  
- Vendors with **lower freight costs (<8%)** maintained higher average profit margins.  

---

### üì¶ Inventory Efficiency

- **Optimal stock turnover** observed between **1.2 ‚Äì 1.8**, balancing sales and inventory.  
- Vendors below **1.0 turnover** exhibited potential overstocking and poor demand planning.  

---

### üö´ Underperforming Vendors

- Vendors **X**, **Y**, and **Z** had **low profit (<10%)** or **negative margins**, mostly due to high freight and poor sales volumes.  
- These vendors are candidates for **renegotiation** or **delisting**.  

---

### üí° Strategic Insights

- Focus on **vendors with consistent high margin** and **efficient stock movement**.  
- **Renegotiate freight contracts** for vendors with high freight-to-sales ratio.  
- **Reduce purchases** from vendors with low turnover or recurring negative profit margins.  
- **Invest in data-driven vendor selection** for future procurement cycles.
