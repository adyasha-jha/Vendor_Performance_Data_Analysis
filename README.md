## üîç Key Analysis Components

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Comprehensive examination of vendor database tables to identify key variables, understand relationships, and ensure data quality before proceeding with further analysis.

#### üìà Summary Statistics Insights

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Findings:**

**Negative & Zero Values:**
- **Gross Profit:** Minimum value of **-$52,002.78** indicates losses on certain products. Some products or transactions may be selling at a loss due to high costs or selling at discounts lower than the purchase price.
- **Profit Margin:** Has a minimum of **-‚àû**, which suggests cases where revenue is zero or even lower than costs.
- **Total Sales Quantity & Sales Dollars:** Minimum values are **0**, meaning some products were purchased but never sold. These could be slow-moving or obsolete stock.

**üîç Outliers Indicated by High Standard Deviations:**
- **Purchase & Actual Prices:** The max values ($5,681.81 & $7,499.99) are significantly higher than the mean ($24.39 & $35.64), indicating potential premium products.
- **Freight Cost:** Huge variation, from $0.09 to $257,032.07, suggests logistics inefficiencies or bulk shipments.
- **Stock Turnover:** Ranges from 0 to 274.5, implying some products sell extremely fast while others remain in stock indefinitely. Value more than 1 indicates that sold quantity for that product is higher than purchased quantity due to either sales being fulfilled from older stock.


---

#### üîó Correlation Insights


**Key Correlations Discovered:**

- **PurchasePrice** has weak correlations with TotalSalesDollars (-0.012) and GrossProfit (-0.016), suggesting that price variations do not significantly impact sales volume or profit.

- **Strong correlation (0.999)** between total purchase quantity and total sales quantity, confirming efficient inventory turnover.

- **Negative correlation** between profit margin & total sales price (-0.179) suggests that as sales price increases, margins decrease, possibly due to competitive pricing pressures.

- **StockTurnover** has weak negative correlations with both GrossProfit (-0.038) and ProfitMargin (-0.055), indicating that faster turnover does not necessarily result in higher profitability.

### 2. **Vendor Performance Analysis**

#### üèÜ Which Vendors and Brands Demonstrate the Highest Sales Performance?


**Top Performing Vendors:**
- **MARTINETTI COMPANIES** leads with the highest transaction volume
- **M S WALKER INC** and **ULTRA BEVERAGE COMPANY LLP** follow as strong performers
- Clear market concentration among top 10 vendors

**Top Performing Brands:**
- **Southern Comfort** dominates product sales
- **Jagermeister Liqueur** and **Bacardi Superior Rum** are strong performers
- **Jim Beam** and **Jack Daniels No 7 Black** maintain consistent sales

---

#### üí∞ Which Vendors Contribute the Most to Total Purchase Dollars?

**Analysis Focus:**
- Identification of vendors contributing most to procurement spending
- Assessment of financial dependency on key suppliers
- Risk evaluation for vendor concentration


---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è How Much of Total Procurement is Dependent on the Top Vendors?

**Key Findings:**
- High concentration risk identified in procurement spending
- Top vendors account for majority of total purchase dollars
- Diversification opportunities identified for risk mitigation

**Recommendations:**
- Develop secondary vendor relationships
- Negotiate better terms with top vendors
- Create contingency plans for critical suppliers

---

### 3. **Bulk Pricing & Cost Optimization**

#### üì¶ Does Purchasing in Bulk Reduce the Unit Price, and What is the Optimal Purchase Volume for Cost Savings?

**Analysis Results:**

‚úÖ **Vendors buying in bulk (large orders) get the lowest unit price ($10.78 per unit)**, meaning higher margins if they can manage inventory efficiently.

‚úÖ **The price difference between small and large orders is substantial (~72% reduction in unit cost)**

‚úÖ **This suggests that bulk pricing strategies successfully encourage vendors to purchase in large volumes, leading to higher overall sales, despite lower per unit revenue.**

**Optimal Purchase Strategy:**
- Balance between cost savings and inventory holding costs
- Larger orders provide significant per-unit savings
- Must consider storage capacity and product shelf life


---

### 4. **Inventory Turnover Analysis**

#### üìâ Which Vendors Have Low Inventory Turnover, Indicating Excess Stock and Slow-Moving Products?

**Findings:**
- Identified vendors with stock turnover below optimal levels
- Highlighted products with extended holding periods
- Assessed impact on working capital


**Key Insights:**
- Some vendors show stock turnover ratios close to 0, indicating minimal movement
- High turnover (>100) suggests sales from older inventory or backorders
- Median turnover varies significantly across vendor categories

---

#### üíµ How Much Capital is Locked in Unsold Inventory Per Vendor, and Which Vendors Contribute the Most to It?

**Capital Analysis:**
- Quantified unsold inventory value per vendor
- Identified top contributors to inventory holding costs
- Highlighted opportunities for inventory reduction strategies

**Impact:**
- Significant working capital tied up in slow-moving inventory
- Opportunity cost of capital locked in excess stock
- Potential for markdown or liquidation strategies

---

### 5. **Profit Margin Analysis**

#### üéØ Identify Brands that Need Promotional or Pricing Adjustments

**Target Brands:**
Brands exhibiting **lower sales performance but higher profit margins** represent opportunities for:
- Volume growth through promotional activities
- Strategic price adjustments to increase market penetration
- Enhanced marketing and distribution efforts

**Strategic Approach:**
- Test price elasticity through limited promotions
- Increase brand visibility and awareness
- Optimize channel distribution

---

### 6. **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**

#### ‚ùì Is There a Significant Difference in Profit Margins Between Top-Performing and Low-Performing Vendors?

**Hypothesis:**
- **H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis):** There is no significant difference in the mean profit margins of top-performing and low-performing vendors.
- **H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis):** The mean profit margins of top-performing and low-performing vendors are significantly different.

**Statistical Results:**

| Vendor Category | Profit Margin Range (95% CI) | Mean |
|----------------|------------------------------|------|
| **Low-Performing Vendors** | 40.48% - 42.62% | ~41.5% |
| **Top-Performing Vendors** | 30.74% - 31.61% | ~31.2% |

**Key Findings:**

‚úÖ **The confidence interval for low-performing vendors (40.48% to 42.62%) is significantly higher than that of top-performing vendors (30.74% to 31.61%).**

‚úÖ **This suggests that vendors with lower sales tend to maintain higher profit margins, potentially due to premium pricing or lower operational costs.**

**Business Implications:**

**For High-Performing Vendors:**
- If they aim to improve profitability, they could explore selective price adjustments
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Bundling strategies to increase average transaction value

**For Low-Performing Vendors:**
- Despite higher margins, their low sales volume might indicate a need for:
  - Better marketing strategies
  - Competitive pricing adjustments
  - Improved distribution channels
  - Enhanced customer engagement
