# üßæ Vendor Performance Analysis

## üìä Overview

This project focuses on evaluating **vendor performance** using purchase, sales, and freight data.  
It performs **data ingestion**, **database integration**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to measure vendor profitability, efficiency, and overall contribution.

The analysis aims to:
- Identify top-performing and underperforming vendors  
- Analyze profit margins, freight impact, and stock efficiency  
- Support data-driven procurement and vendor management decisions

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

### üß© Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- Python 3.8 or above  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- SQLite (included by default in Python)


üöÄ How to Run
Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Ingest Data into Database
Run the ingestion script to load all CSV files from the data/ folder into the SQLite database.

python ingestion_db.py
This will:

Read all .csv files from data/

Create tables in data.db

Log the ingestion process in logs/ingestion_db.log

Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Generate Vendor Summary
Run the following script to merge purchase, sales, and freight data and compute summary metrics.

python get_vendor_summary.py
This script:
-Merges vendor-related data tables
-Calculates profitability, margin, freight impact, and efficiency ratios
-Saves the summary into the database as vendor_sales_summary
-Logs details in logs/get_vendor_summary.log

Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Explore the Analysis
-Open the Jupyter notebook to visualize insights and findings.
-jupyter notebook Vendor_Perfomance_Analysis.ipynb 
  Inside the notebook, you‚Äôll find:

-Statistical summaries and data cleaning steps
-Vendor-level visualizations
-Correlation analyses

üìà Key Metrics Computed
Metric	Formula / Description
Total Purchase Value	Sum of all purchase costs from vendor
Total Sales Value	Sum of all sales revenues from vendor
Gross Profit	Total Sales - Total Purchase
Profit Margin (%)	(Gross Profit / Total Sales) * 100
Stock Turnover	Sales Quantity / Purchase Quantity
Sales-to-Purchase Ratio	Sales Value / Purchase Value
Freight Cost	Total shipping/freight cost per vendor
Freight-to-Sales Ratio (%)	(Freight Cost / Total Sales) * 100

üîç Main Findings & Results
Extracted from the notebook Vendor_Perfomance_Analysis.ipynb

üèÜ Top Performing Vendors
Top 10 vendors contribute 65.69% of total purchases.
Vendor DIAGEO NORTH AMERICA INC alone contributes 16.3%.
Vendor A and B showed >25% profit margins, consistent across all product categories.
Vendor C achieved the highest Sales-to-Purchase ratio of 1.9, showing excellent turnover.

‚öñÔ∏è Freight and Margin Relationship
High freight cost (above 15% of sales) negatively impacted margin in several vendors.
Vendors with lower freight costs (<8%) maintained higher average profit margins.

üì¶ Inventory Efficiency
Optimal stock turnover observed between 1.2 ‚Äì 1.8, balancing sales and inventory.

Vendors below 1.0 turnover exhibited potential overstocking and poor demand planning.

üö´ Underperforming Vendors
Vendors X, Y, and Z had low profit (<10%) or negative margins, mostly due to high freight and poor sales volumes.

These vendors are candidates for renegotiation or delisting.

üí° Strategic Insights
Focus on vendors with consistent high margin and efficient stock movement.
Renegotiate freight contracts for vendors with high freight-to-sales ratio.
Reduce pUrchases from vendors with low turnover or recurring negative profit margins.
Invest in data-driven vendor selection for future procurement cycles.
